  --------------------    Installation of dviout   ---------------------

0. Preceding the installation of dviout, install (some of) font files 
   (including tfm files and PK files used by dviout) if possible. 
   dviout will search the location of fonts in the installation procedure.

   If MikTeX system is solely used, dviout reads its font setting and 
   therefore this step is unnecesary.

   If PostScript files (EPSF's) are used for figures, install Ghostscript 
   and correctly set the environment variable GS_LIB.  

   For example, suppose mktexpk is correctly supported and the default 
   mode for the printer is set to execute METAFONT.  PK files for some 
   basic fonts are created by the command

       mktexpk cmr10      300 300 300/300
       mktexpk cmr10      360 300 360/300

       mktexpk line10     300 300 300/300
       mktexpk line10     360 300 360/300
       mktexpk lcircle10  300 300 300/300
       mktexpk lcircle10  360 300 360/300

       mktexpk msam10     300 300 300/300
       mktexpk msam10     300 300 300/300
       mktexpk eufm10     300 300 300/300
       mktexpk eufm10     360 300 360/300

   if the dpi of printer resolution equals 300.  Then dviout will find the
   settings of the location of fonts (dviout will check the existence and 
   the location of fonts cmr10, line10, lcircle10, msam10, eufm10, min10, 
   tmin10).  According to the mktexpk, the above command should be changed
   like

       mktexpk --dpi 360 --bdpi 300 --mag 360/300 cmr10

   In the system of MikTeX, makepk is a replacement of mktexpk.


1. Make a directory (with any name as you like but 
   c:\dviout is the default) for dviout and execute dviout.

   For example, in a CMD Window, type

       mkdir c:\dviout
       cd    c:\dviout
       c:
       unzip d:\dviout3190-inst.zip
       dviout

   if d:\dviout3190-inst.zip is the package of dviout.

   Then you will be asked to install fundamental parameters.  If you push
   [Yes] button,  you will be guide to the steps corresponding to the 
   following 2, 3, 4 and others.  Otherwise you should do the following.

   Remark: If your operating system does not support Japanese language and 
           you are asked to use the original font at the start up of dviout, 
           please answer "No" to continue. 


2. Set the resolution of fonts by dpi(dots par inch).

   We recommend to set the resolution matching to the printer usually used.
   DVI files are previewed by shrinking size of fonts and using gray scale.

      Select: Option (tool bar in dviout) -> Setup parameters -> Resolution
      Set the correct number of resolution dpi:
      push [Save],
      push [OK].


3. Suppose font griph files are PK fonts and they are installed with 
   names such as cmr10.300pk or *300*\...\cmr10.pk.  Then it is easy to
   set the parameter of dviout defining the location of fonts:

      Select: Option (tool bar in dviout) -> Setup parameters -> Font
      push [Guess],
      push [Save],
      push [OK].

     If MikTeX will be solely used for TeX, then answer [Yes] for the
   question "Do you use MikTeX?"

     Note that -TEXPK: indicates the location of fonts (PK fonts).  
   Use [Help] or "?" button to get more informations.

     In the case of a standard configuration of directories for fonts,
   for example, the setting such as

       -TEXROOT:^T\fonts
       -TEXPK:^r\tfm\\^s.^tfm;^r\pk\\^s.^dpk;^r\vf\\^s.vf;^r\tfm\\^s.tfm

   will be automatically done.  Here "^r\pk\\^s.^dpk" is for PK fonts, 
   "^r\tfm\\^s.^tfm" is for TrueType fonts and "^r\vf\\^s.vf" is for 
   virtual fonts.  In some case, "^r\pk\\^s.^dpk" may be changed to
   "^r\pk\cx\\^s.^dpk;^r\pk\modeless\\^s.^dpk".  Here "cx" may be 
   replaced by mode for printer used by METAFONT.
     The last ;^r\tfm\\^s.tfm is better to be removed if non Japanese
   TrueType font is installed.

     On the other hand, if TrueType fonts registered in Windows are solely
   used, then the parameter setting is as follows:

      Select: Option (tool bar in dviout) -> Setup parameters -> Font
      and set the location of tfm files to -TEXPK: as follows

       -TEXROOT:^T\fonts
       -TEXPK:^r\tfm\\^s.^tfm

     Similarly if TrueType fonts have priority than other fonts and morevoer 
   Omega/lambda is used, the setting of -TEXPK: may be as follows

       -TEXROOT:^T\fonts
       -TEXPK:^r\tfm\\^s^tfm;^r\pk\\^s.^dpk;\r\vf\\^s.vf;\r\ovf\\^s.ovf

     If a Japanese TruType font is installed, it is better to add  ;^r\tfm\\^s.tfm 
   at the end of the definition of -TEXPK: 

     Then validitate these settings:

      push [Save],
      push [OK].

     Here "^r" in -TEXPK: is substituted by the setting of -TEXROOT:
   "^s" and "^d" are substituted by the font name such as "cmr10" and
   the resolution of the font under dpi, respectively, "^T" is substituted
   by the value of environment variable TEXMFMAIN or TEXMF  and "\\" is 
   any sequence of subdirectories as is similarly used in kpathsearch.
   ^s^tfm indicates the location of tfm/jfm files to use the TrueType fonts
   through the Windows system.
   This setting should be arranged according to your system.

     In case of MikTeX, PK fonts are stored as  ...\dpi300\cmr10.pk and those
   parameters are, for example, one may set manually as

     -TEXROOT:c:\Local TEXMF\fonts;c:\texmf\fonts
     -TEXPK:^r\pk\\dpi^d\^s.pk;^r\tfm\\^s.^tfm;^r\vf\\^s.vf

   Here  c:\Local TEXMF\fonts  and  c:\texm\fonts  depend on the installation
   of MikTeX.  MikTeX supports  makepk.exe  and dviout can use it after the 
   setting:

      Select: Option (tool bar in dviout) -> Setup parameters -> Font2
      push [gen:],
      push [Save],
      push [OK].

  This is also valid if mktexpk or MakeTeXPK is supported.


4. If Goshscript is installed and the environment variable GS_LIB is 
  correctly set, 

      Select: Option (tool bar in dviout) -> Setup parameters -> Graphic
      push [gsx:],
      push [Save],
      push [OK].


5. Now you are ready to preview and print DVI files.

   The DVI file  test_org.dvi  and  sample\sample.dvi  in the package 
   of dviout is good for the first test of the preview.

      Select File -> Open a DVI file from Tool Bar.  Previewing the DVI file,

      Select Display -> Size -> Magnify/Reduce, Display -> Contrast ->
      Blacker/Whiter

   to get a suitable result and

      Select: Option -> Setup parameters -> Display
      push [Save],
      push [OK].

   to reserve it.

   The DVI file  graphic\color\color.dvi  is an another DVI file written 
   in  English.


6. Other options are also set from  Option -> Setup parameters.
   Their explanation can be seen from On-line Help in English/Japanese.

---
7. You can get a precise information on dviout by On-line Help whose 
   filename is dvioute.hlp (in English) or dviout.hlp (in Japanese).

8. Uninstallation of dviout for Windows can be done by the menu in dviout.

   ----------------  Installation of other packages  ------------------

             ---  A package for Windows TrueType fonts ---

font\winttf.zip  : A package to use Windows standard TrueType fonts (Times New 
Roman, Arial, Courier New, proportional Japanese fonts etc.) written by Otobe 
and Oshima

font\exjfonts.zip: Japanese extended package.


If the directories of TeX are standard, the package is installed as follows.

  In a MS-DOS Window, move to the directory where the subdirectory texmf exist.

  Unpack winttf.zip in the directory:

       unzip winttf.zip 

  In dviout for Windows, select

       Option -> Setup Parameters... -> Font2 -> ttf:

  and indicate the file  ^x\map\ttfonts.map  and push [Flush], [Apply] and [OK].

  Moreover move to the sheet [Font] and indicate tfm and vf files in TEXPK.
  For example:

      TEXROOT: ^T\fonts
      TEXPK: ^r\tfm\\^s.^tfm;^r\pk\cx\\^s.^dpk;^r\vf\\^s.vf

  Then [Save] and [OK] to quit the property sheet.

  To check the installation, preview the following sample file by dviout 
  for Windows:

      ....\texmf\tex\latex\ttnfss\test.dvi

  See English.txt and the comments in ttfonts.map contained in the package 
for more information.

  To install exjfonts.zip, unpack it in the same way as in the case of 
winttf.zip.


                           ---  PSfrag ---

  If PSfrag is used, psfrag.pro in PSfrag package and ps2frag.ps in PSfrag 
package Ver.2.* should be placed in a search path of Ghostscript.
(See the URL of dviout for Windows given below.) 


             --- Image data files in various formats ---

  To handle image data files other than EPS/PS/WMF/EMF/PBM/BMC such as JPEG/
TIFF/GIF/PNG/PCD etc., the corresponding Susie plug-in's (with the extension
.spi) should be placed in the directry which should be indicated in

       Option -> Setup Parameters... -> Graphic -> spi:


    ---  Usage of Japanese TrueType fonts under non-Japanese Windows ---

  See On-line Help:

    Help -> Help topics -> Q&A -> Font ->
    ? Will TrueType Japanese fonts be used in non-Japanese Windows
